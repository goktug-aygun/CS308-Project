# Welcome to Our Flight Roster Project!

## What is This Project About?
We're building a website to help airlines organize their flights. This includes sorting out who's flying the plane, who's helping onboard, and where passengers sit.

## What Can This Website Do?
- **Pick and View Flights**: You can look up flights by their number or other details and see who's working on them.
- **Know Your Crew and Passengers**: Find out who the pilots and cabin crew are, and get details on everyone flying.
- **Store and Share Flight Details**: Keep track of flight info and share it easily.

## Why Are We Doing This?
We want to make flying smoother for everyone, from the crew to the passengers.

## How Can You Help?
Just take a look around, give us feedback.
